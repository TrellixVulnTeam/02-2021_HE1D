# in able to use these function you have to import python
# this will grab a bunch of math function that  mathw can use
# such as the floor method
# math is a module.... allows you to use more math functions
from math import *





# can use decimal and negative numebrs as well

print(2.09987)


# you can print to use math functions
print(3 + 5)


# you can specify the order of operations
print(3 * (4+5))

# the modulus operator show the remaining number after the division
print(10 % 3)



# how to add a num variable
my_num = -5
print(my_num)

#convert number to string ... to concat to a string you have to convert the number to a string first with str

print(str(my_num) + " iss my favorite number" )

# abs stands for absolute value . the abouslute value of negative 5 is 5
print(abs(my_num))

# to raise a numebr to an exponent use the pow function first parameter is the number you want to use the power to , sencond si the power numebr


print(pow(4,6))

# the max function will tell you the highest number
print(max(4,6))

# the min is the same

print(min(4,6))


# if you have a decimal that you ant to round use thew round function

print(round(3.546))


# to use the floor method you have to import the math functions.....see line 2
# the floor grabs the lowest numb
print(floor(3.7))


# same with ceil must import
#ceil grabs the highest number
print(ceil(3.7))

# must be imported
#gives you the square root
print(sqrt(36))
