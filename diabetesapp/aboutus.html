    <h1>About Aron</h1>
    <p id ="intro">
        Aron born October 24 2017, one of the happiest most lovable boys you will ever meet. He has always loved super heros. His favorite has to be Spider-man, or the Hulk. But if he had to choose he will easily say "Spider-Hulk". He is a strong willed boy, who doesnt let anything get in his way.  You can tell at such a young age the passion in his eyes when he tries his hardest to accomplish his goal. Even at 3. His will of fire burns brightest when things are difficult for him. He never gives up regardless of how frustrated he gets. He is a gaurdian. He doesn't let anyone hurt the people he cares about. Even if they are just playing around. He doesn't like it. He has the outmost loyalty to the people he cares about. Something he gets from his father.
